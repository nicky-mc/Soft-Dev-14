          A remote stellar nursery is home to a group of newly formed worlds,
          some as large as Jupiter. The smallest of these is encircled by a
          dusty disk that could eventually lead to the formation of moons. This
          significant discovery, made possible by the exceptional sensitivity of
          the James Webb Space Telescope, may offer fresh perspectives on the
          processes of star and planet formation, according to researchers in a
          study set to be published in The Astronomical Journal. Stars form from
          vast clouds of gas and dust when certain regions collapse under
          gravitational forces. This same mechanism can also produce smaller
          celestial bodies, such as giant planets and brown dwarfs, which do not
          possess the internal pressure necessary for hydrogen fusion (SN:
          7/24/17). In the young star cluster NGC1333, located approximately
          1,000 light-years away in the constellation Perseus, astronomers
          discovered hundreds of newly formed starlike objects, including six
          young planets with masses ranging from five to 15 times that of
          Jupiter. The dusty disk surrounding the smallest planet resembles
          those found around young stars, which are known to develop into
          planetary systems. According to Adam Langeveld, an astrophysicist at
          Johns Hopkins University, this disk may one day evolve into a system
          of orbiting moons.
